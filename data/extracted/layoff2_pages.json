While\nWARN requires only 60 days\u2019 advance notice, Amazon is providing at least 90 days\u2019 notice to all affected employees before\ntheir separations are scheduled to occur. Affected employees who accept internal transfer opportunities at Amazon prior to\ntheir separation date will not be separated as a result of this action.\nEmployee separations resulting from this action are expected to be permanent. The affected employees are not represented\nby a union or any other collective bargaining representative. Amazon and its affiliates do not allow separated employees to\ndisplace any other employee based on seniority or any other factor (i.e., no \u201cbumping rights\u201d exist). Affected employees\nwho are separated as a result of this action will be paid all wages and other benefits to which they are entitled (if any)\nthrough their date of separation, provided they do not resign from their employment with Amazon prior to that date. On or\nbefore the effective date of each employee\u2019s separation, Amazon will provide information concerning benefits and (as\napplicable) severance available under separate cover to eligible affected employees. This action is not the result of, nor\nreasonably expected to result in, any overall relocation or contracting out of Amazon\u2019s Washington operations/employee\npositions.\nA list of the job titles held by the above-referenced affected employees, and the number of affected employees holding each\nsuch job title, is attached hereto. At Amazon we take the responsibility of protecting the personal information of our\nemployees very seriously, including taking steps to ensure that any recipients of such information maintain it confidentially.\nGiven that this notice is generally obtainable by third parties, and that affected employees have a legitimate privacy interest\nin not having their names, contact information, and selection for layoff made available to the general public for review,\nrepublication, or other purposes, we have omitted employee names and home addresses from this notice. The privacy\ninterest here is the same interest that underlies the confidentiality of unemployment compensation information in the\nEmployment Security Department\u2019s files. RCW 50.13.020. To assist with communication between affected employees and\nthe Department, we are providing the Department\u2019s contact information to all affected employees.\nWe are providing you with this notice based upon the best information available to us at this time and do not plan to provide\nfuture notices with respect to this action. We wish to provide you with notices that are helpful, rather than inundate you with\nrepeated or intermittent updates. However, please let us know if you would like us to provide you with future notices or\nadditional information."
